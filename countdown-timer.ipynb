    "## 3.Create the Label- Widget Function\n",
    "We create a function called ```countDown()``` to display and update the countdown timer. It takes a parameter named seconds. If the seconds value is non-negative, the function breaks it down into hours, minutes, and seconds using the ```divmod()``` function. The time is then formatted as hour:minute:second and displayed on the label widget. To ensure the countdown continues smoothly, the function uses ```root.after(1000, countDown, seconds - 1)``` to schedule itself to run again after one second, creating a loop without freezing the GUI. When the countdown reaches zero, it updates the label with a ```\"Time's up!\"``` message, signaling the end of the timer."
